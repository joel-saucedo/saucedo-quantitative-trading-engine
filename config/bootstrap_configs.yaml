# Bootstrap Configuration Profiles
# Different configurations for development vs production analysis

development:
  # Fast configuration for development and testing
  n_sims: 100                    # Reduced simulations for speed
  batch_size: 50                 # Smaller batches for memory efficiency
  block_length: 10               # Standard block length
  method: "IID"                  # Fastest method for development
  confidence_level: 0.95

production:
  # Full configuration for production analysis
  n_sims: 1000                   # Full simulation count
  batch_size: 100                # Larger batches for efficiency
  block_length: 10               # Standard block length
  method: "BLOCK"                # More sophisticated for production
  confidence_level: 0.95
